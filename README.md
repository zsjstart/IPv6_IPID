# SoK_IPID_techniques
IPID Time Series Forecasting, denoted as IPID-TSF, enables the learning of the historical changing behavior of an IPID counter to predict its future IPID values. 
It is tailored to address two major limitations in existing measurement techniques that are built on IPID side channels.
Firstly, IPID-TSF facilitates understanding of IPID behavior within IPv6 environments, paving the way for techniques predominantly used in IPv4 networks to be applied in IPv6 contexts. 
Secondly, IPID-TSF dispenses with the assumption of stable IPID growth and instead actively assesses the predictability of IPIDs. This allows for the selection of IPIDs that demonstrate high predictability for measurement purposes, thus ensuring the reliability of the outcomes.
